# spangap-web

## What is this?

**spangap-web** is the web-stack half of the [spangap](../spangap)
platform: an HTTPS server, cookie-session auth, the WebRTC plumbing
(DTLS/ICE-lite/SCTP) that carries every device↔browser data path, and
the shared browser UI shell (FloatingWindow, MenuBar, SettingX,
TerminalWindow, LogWindow, WebRTC session manager, auth flow, storage
sync, menu registry, Pinia stores).

It is **the browser-side UI activator**: when this straddle is in the
dep graph (and `--no-web-ui` is not set), the build picks up every
other straddle's `browser/` subdir and includes its `init()` in the
generated browser dispatcher.

## What this straddle owns

## How others use it

### Firmware side

```cpp
webInit();        // HTTPS + REST + WS helpers
authInit();       // cookie sessions, realms
webrtcInit();     // DTLS/ICE/SCTP, generic DC↔ITS router
```

Register an HTTP URL prefix that hands the connection off to your task:

```cpp
web_path_msg_t wreg = { .itsPort = MY_PORT };
safeStrncpy(wreg.path, "mypath", sizeof(wreg.path));
itsSendAux("web", WEB_PATH_REG_PORT, &wreg, sizeof(wreg), pdMS_TO_TICKS(500));
```

Register a content transform by file extension — the served file's bytes
(decompressed if it was `.gz` on disk) are handed to your callback, which
returns a response body. Used by the viewer to render `*.md` as HTML on-device;
the web server stays format-agnostic:

```cpp
webRegisterFileExt("md,markdown", myMdToHtml);   // → text/html
```

The server also honours `Accept-Encoding`: a `.gz` file is sent verbatim
(`Content-Encoding: gzip`) only to clients that advertise gzip; others get it
inflated on the fly (ROM `tinfl`, zero added flash). Transformed bodies are
always sent uncompressed.

Add a browser DataChannel by opening an ITS server port and letting the
WebRTC task auto-route `<task>:<n>` labels to it. See
[spangap/INTERNALS.md](../spangap/INTERNALS.md) "Add a browser
DataChannel" for the full recipe.

### Browser side

See [browser/README.md](browser/README.md) for the npm install + import
patterns. The package is `spangap-browser` (unscoped). Subpath imports
pull only the pieces you need; modules in `modules/*` self-register
with `menuRegistry` on import.

## The WebRTC pattern

The webrtc task is **content-free**. It terminates DTLS/ICE/SCTP and
routes a DataChannel labelled `<task>:<n>` to ITS port `n` on
`<task>`, in both directions. Adding a browser↔device channel is
opening an ITS port on one side and naming a DataChannel on the other —
no signalling code, no payload knowledge in the WebRTC task,
per-channel reliability.

One `RTCPeerConnection` and one DTLS handshake per browser tab carry
every data path at once — config sync, log, CLI, and any app-defined
media or file stream.

## What it does NOT own

- WiFi / TCP / TLS — in [spangap-net](../spangap-net).
- The HTTPS *certificate* — `spangap-net` owns the mbedTLS server; this
  straddle slots into it.
- Camera / video / RTSP UI — those live in the consuming app's browser
  subdir.

## Lockstep with `spangap-core`

The browser package shape mirrors what's exposed over the storage
DataChannel and the various WS / HTTP endpoints from `spangap-core` and
the other firmware straddles. When firmware changes its public protocol
(config keys, storage tree shape, DC port assignments), the browser
package must follow in lockstep. Versions move together.
